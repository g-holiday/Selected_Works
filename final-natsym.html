        National Symbols
      </h1>
      <h3 class="blurb">
        The national symbols of Scotland combine to create an iconic image of the
        country that is instantly recognizable and unforgettable. Here are but a few: 
        St. Andrew's Cross, or the "Saltire" as it is commonly known, is said to be the 
        oldest flag still in use; the thistle, which is Scotland's floral emblem, is a commonly
        occurring plant and perhaps suggestive of a prickly demeanor; also, an example of tartan cloth
        is shown, and these multi-colored, skirt-like garments were worn by men of the Scottish
        Highlands in ages past. Don't peek underneath the hem if you see someone wearing one, 
        though--you might be in for a shock.
