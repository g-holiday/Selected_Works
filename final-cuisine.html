        Scottish fare is typically hearty and based on numerous types of game and fish with generous 
        servings of vegetables on the side; soup might also be consumed during the colder months (some might say 
        the climate is cold enough year-round). Then there is the legendary (some would say infamous)
        haggis, a type of pudding made out of "sheep's pluck", or the sheep's heart liver and lungs which are 
        then minced with onion, oatmeal, and spices and traditionally cooked in the animal's stomach (nowadays
        haggis can be purchased in sausage casing). For the less adventurous, more conventional British staples
        such as fish and chips are also available. To top it all off, dessert is definitely one of the 
        sweeter things in life; the shortbread is world-famous.
